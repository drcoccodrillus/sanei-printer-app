## Troubleshooting

Sometimes things simply go wrong. If you need to troubleshoot CUPS these are places you should look at:
- `/var/log/cups/access_log` - Lists all cupsd http1.1 server activity
- `/var/log/cups/error_log` - Lists detailed information of the printing process
- `/var/log/cups/page_log` - Echoes a new entry each time a print is successful
- `/var/spool/cups` - Location where the scheduler stores job files


The best way to get complete information from log files is to set `LogLevel` in `/etc/cups/cupsd.conf` as the following:

```
LogLevel debug
```

And then viewing the output from `/var/log/cups/error_log` like this:
```
tail -n 100 -f /var/log/cups/error_log
```

The `/var/spool/cups` location stores two types of files: control files starting with the letter "c" and data files starting with the letter "d". Control files are IPP messages based on the original IPP Print-Job or Create-Job messages, while data files are the original print files that were submitted for printing. There is one control file for every job known to the system and 0 or more data files for each job.

Control files are normally cleaned out after the 500th job is submitted, while data files are removed immediately after a job has successfully printed. Both behaviors can be configured.
